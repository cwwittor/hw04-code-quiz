Homework 4 for my bootcamp class

Was pressed and busy for a lot of the week so didnt have too much time to even fit this in and in the end I couldn't get it fully working due to not understanding why I couldn't do the different functions to the leaderboard. Almost everything else was finished and done with fairly easily aside from that though. We had done a lot of work involving web apis in class this past week and it was pretty interesting albeit a bit confusing. This homework assignment is supposed to generate a quiz with given assets and it will time, score, and test the user taking the quiz.

I think the thing I had probably learned the most from this assignment was how to utilize certain api's for different uses in JS.
